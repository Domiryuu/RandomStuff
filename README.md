A repository for Random Code, Tests, Examples, and things I want to remember.

### Note for contributers
When contributing either code or requests just keep in mind that this repository is for educational perposes only.
as such the code is not always intended to be "the most ifficant" or "the best" way of doing something and usualy has no purpose.
